# New site, who this?
_15 February 2017_

Welcome to my new homepage! Since I've owned my domain for almost three years now,
I always wanted to do something useful with it. I recently started using it as
my primary email ([andrew@andrewsosa.com](mailto:andrew@andrewsosa.com)), and
I figured I might as well create a homepage for it as well.

To create this site, I used Pug (formerly Jade) and Sass, as well as the tool
Gulp to automatically build the two into their respective languages (being
HTML and CSS). These posts are actually written in Markdown, and included into
the `.pug` files via the `markdown-it` filter for Pug.

All together, creating this site was an excellent adventure in new tools,
languages, and frameworks that took just over a day to complete, including
the design process in Affinity Designer.

I plan to expand this page to include an extended resume section which doubles
as a gallery of my related work and activities.

Until then, cheers!
