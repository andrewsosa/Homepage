# HackFSU Android Workshop
_16 February 2017_

This year I've been honored with privildge to lead an Android workshop at [**HackFSU**](http://hackfsu.com).
Maybe a little less honored since the workshop is at 3am, but hey â€“ I'm still
excited!

The workshop is aimed at developers who've never worked with Android before.
Here's a rough outline of the presentation:

1. **Intro to Android**: A short 5-10 minute overview of what Android is, how it
works, and high level code concepts for developing for Android.
2. **Code Examples**: Here's I'll be demonstrating the concepts we covered by
repairing intentional damage to the HackFSU app. Participants can follow along
on their own machines we implement the app's update fetching feature.
3. **Firebase Demo**: Finally, the participants and I will work in parallel to
create a simple chat application using [**Firebase**](http://firebase.google.com). By the end of the workshop,
the participants will be able to all connect to the same chat groups and send
each-other messages.

The slides are still in progress, but they'll certainly be ready before the
workshop early Saturday morning.

UPDATE: Slides are done! You can find them [**here**](./workshop.pdf).

See you there!
