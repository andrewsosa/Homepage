<h1>HackFSU Android Workshop</h1>
<p><em>16 February 2017</em></p>
<p>This year I've been honored with privildge to lead an Android workshop at <a href="http://hackfsu.com"><strong>HackFSU</strong></a>.
Maybe a little less honored since the workshop is at 3am, but hey â€“ I'm still
excited!</p>
<p>The workshop is aimed at developers who've never worked with Android before.
Here's a rough outline of the presentation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Intro to Android</strong>: A short 5-10 minute overview of what Android is, how it
works, and high level code concepts for developing for Android.</li>
<li><strong>Code Examples</strong>: Here's I'll be demonstrating the concepts we covered by
repairing intentional damage to the HackFSU app. Participants can follow along
on their own machines we implement the app's update fetching feature.</li>
<li><strong>Firebase Demo</strong>: Finally, the participants and I will work in parallel to
create a simple chat application using <a href="http://firebase.google.com"><strong>Firebase</strong></a>. By the end of the workshop,
the participants will be able to all connect to the same chat groups and send
each-other messages.</li>
</ol>
<p>The slides are still in progress, but they'll certainly be ready before the
workshop early Saturday morning.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Slides are done! You can find them <a href="./workshop.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>

<p><em>15 February 2017</em></p>
<p>Welcome to my new homepage! Since I've owned my domain for almost three years now,
I always wanted to do something useful with it. I recently started using it as
my primary email (<a href="mailto:andrew@andrewsosa.com">andrew@andrewsosa.com</a>), and
I figured I might as well create a homepage for it as well.</p>
<p>To create this site, I used Pug (formerly Jade) and Sass, as well as the tool
Gulp to automatically build the two into their respective languages (being
HTML and CSS). These posts are actually written in Markdown, and included into
the <code>.pug</code> files via the <code>markdown-it</code> filter for Pug.</p>
<p>All together, creating this site was an excellent adventure in new tools,
languages, and frameworks that took just over a day to complete, including
the design process in Affinity Designer.</p>
<p>I plan to expand this page to include an extended resume section which doubles
as a gallery of my related work and activities.</p>
<p>Until then, cheers!</p>
